            "question": "How are transaction fees calculated?",
            "answer": "Transaction fees consist of two parts: a percentage rate and a fixed fee. For example, 2.9% + $0.30 means you pay 2.9% of the transaction amount plus a fixed fee of $0.30 per transaction. For a $100 transaction, you would pay $2.90 in percentage fees and $0.30 in fixed fees, totaling $3.20."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why do different payment methods have different rates?",
            "answer": "Different payment methods have different rates that reflect the cost structure, risk level, and processing complexity of various payment channels. For example, international credit cards typically have higher rates because they involve cross-border processing and currency conversion, while local payment methods often have lower rates."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does the settlement cycle work?",
            "answer": "The settlement cycle refers to the time it takes for funds to reach your bank account after a successful transaction. The Standard package has a 7-day settlement cycle, the Business package offers a 3-day cycle, and the Enterprise package provides T+1 settlement (next business day after the transaction). Shorter settlement cycles help you access your funds faster."
          },
          {
            "question": "Are there minimum monthly fees or setup fees?",
            "answer": "We do not charge minimum monthly fees or setup fees. You only pay for the transactions you process. If you don't have any transactions, you don't pay any fees, making our service particularly friendly for seasonal businesses or merchants with fluctuating transaction volumes."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I get custom pricing for the Enterprise package?",
            "answer": "If your monthly transaction volume exceeds 100,000 transactions or you have specific business requirements, please contact our sales team. We'll provide a custom pricing plan based on your transaction volume, industry type, and specific needs. Enterprise package customers also receive a dedicated account manager and priority support services."

          "question": "Can I switch between plans?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. If you upgrade, you'll be charged the prorated amount for the remainder of your billing cycle. If you downgrade, the new rate will take effect at the beginning of your next billing cycle."
